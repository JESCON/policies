Refund Policy - The refund policy is available under certain circumstances, such as when the hospital cancels the appointment, if the patient's medical condition changes, or in other exceptional situations.

It's important to read and understand the hospital booking app's cancellation and refund policy before making an appointment to avoid any confusion or unexpected charges.
